# Useful resources for organizing and running workshop

## Code of Conduct Incident Reporting

All members of the Commons are expected to follow the [code of conduct][CoC].
[This document][safer] provides a list of actions event organizers can take 
before the event in order to ensure the safety of their participants, 
and ensure that participants feel comfortable reporting any Code of Conduct incidents.
In the event of a violation of the code of conduct,
[this template][template] is a useful resource for documenting the incident and incident response.

## Guide to Unconferencing

An "unconference" is a loosely structured conference emphasizing the 
informal exchange of information and ideas between participants, 
rather than following a conventionally structured program of events.
[This document][unconference] provides a list of actions event organizers can take
to successfully organize and run an unconference.

## Inclusivity

Some individuals face inequitable hurdles to fully attending and participating in conference activities. 
[This document][childcare] provides a list of actions event organizers can take 
to make the event more accessible to attendees who are primary caretakers of dependent children.
[This blog post][inclusivity blog] provides a list of actions for making events more inclusive to
those with hearing or vision difficulties, underrepresented minorities, non-drinkers, or
those in need of financial support.
