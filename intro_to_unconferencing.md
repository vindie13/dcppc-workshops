## Introduction

* Intro, caveats, plans for this doc
   * This is only a first draft/outline to get us started
   * Will collaborate to mold into something that suits our audience
      * Turn into full paragraphs/documentation once the outline is settled
   * Once good enough, add to Team Copper GitHub repo and/or DCPPC wiki (if one exists)
      * Start building a repository of helpful, self-serve documentation
* Defined: What even is?
   * Semi-structured conference
      * Usually based around a broader topic
      * DCPPC, for instance, but individual KCs could benefit from their own unconferences
         * Encourage this & offer to help facilitate
   * Emergent schedule
      * Defined by attendees onsite at the event
* Goals
   * Flex to the needs of the attendees, not to the needs of the organisers
   * Facilitate free & open collaboration & sharing of ideas
   * Capture those ideas to share with those who aren’t at the event
* General framework
   * Introductory remarks
      * Usually after a keynote or some such (lightning talks, in our case)
      * 20-30 minutes
      * Explain what even is, how things will work for rest of the day
   * Scheduling session
      * Typically takes 30-60 minutes
   * Break (lunch)
   * Sessions
      * 45-50 minutes works pretty well[a][b]
      * Allows 10-15 minutes for passing time/grabbing coffee
   * Break (coffee; doesn’t have to be too long)
   * Reconvene for summaries/wrap up

## Setup

* Scheduling
   * Should have seats for all unconference attendees
   * Microphone/loudspeaker very helpful and preferred
   * Need a large vertical space for setting up the schedule[c][d]
      * Wall, whiteboard
      * If schedule is not movable (wall, for instance), room should be accessible during/between sessions for schedule reference
   * Schedule pre-marked into a grid
      * Columns for each timeslot
      * Rows for each room
   * Need large unlined (just blank paper, no lines) sticky notes for session submissions
      * 4”x6” good, but 8”x6” can work if you know you have a lot of space to build the schedule (large wall)
   * Need a bunch of dark pens
      * Sharpies are pretty great for this
   * Need a table for stickies, pens, writing on one with the other
* Session spaces
   * Physically separated from each other enough that conversation doesn’t bleed through to other sessions
   * White board, if possible
   * Table really nice to have but not required
      * If there is one, round is best
   * Chairs set up in a circle
* Wrap-up
   * Typically in the same space as the scheduling, but could be elsewhere
   * Should have seats for all unconference attendees
   * Microphone/loudspeaker very helpful and preferred
