### Agenda

The skeleton [agenda is here](http://nih-data-commons.us/2018-august-workshop/agenda). As before, we will have lightning talks in the morning and breakout groups in the afternoon. Please pay attention to the time when giving talks to ensure that all speakers have equal time to answer questions. 

In order to have a finalize agenda at the start of the workshop, please submit breakout groups suggestions and sign up to give a talk on Friday, August 24. You can do so by [opening or commenting on an issue in the workshop Github repository](https://github.com/dcppc/2018-august-workshop/issues). 

As always, the lightning talks will be [broadcast and recorded via Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/364678101). Requests for Zoom breakout sessions can be made directly in the related issue, communicated over [Slack](http://bit.ly/DCPPCslack), or via email to <dcppc.inbox@gmail.com>.
