We are excited to invite you to to the next two monthly workshops! 

Here are the links to the workshop websites with all the details you need and want!
-  June 29-30 in Portland, OR: http://nih-data-commons.us/2018-june-workshop/
-  July 25-26 in Chapel Hill, NC: http://nih-data-commons.us/2018-july-workshop/ 

**Wondering if you should attend these monthly meetings?** 
Feedback from the May post-workshop survey confirmed that these meetings
are extremely useful for discussing details, obstacles, and goals in a smaller setting! 
Your fellow DCPPC colleagues recommend that 
_"each team to bring their developers"_ and that 
_"everyone from each team should attend at least once"_. 

Team Copper is covering all your travel expenses! 
We are also incorporating your excellent suggestions to improve the quality and utility of these workshops. 

We would love to see 3-6 members representing each Team and Data Steward at both meetings.

Let us know if you have any questions or concerns!

Best,

Rayna (and the rest of Team Copper)
