We are excited to invite you to to the next two monthly workshops! 

Here are the links to the workshop websites with (hopefully) all the details you need and want!
-  [une 29-30 at Reed College in Portland, OR](http://nih-data-commons.us/2018-june-workshop/) 
-  [July 25-26 at RENCI in Chapel Hill, NC](http://nih-data-commons.us/2018-july-workshop/) 

Wondering if you should attend these monthly meetings? Your fellow DCPPC colleagues recommend that 
_"everyone from each team should attend at least one"_ and that 
_"it's very important for each team to bring their developers"_.
Also, Team Copper is covering all your travel expenses!

We would love to see 3-5 members from each Team and each Data Steward at both meetings.

Let us know if you have any questions or concerns!

Best,
Rayna (Team Copper)

P.S. We're working on a high-level report from the May workshop. 
The preliminary analysis says that these workshops are 
extremely useful for discussing details, obstacles, and goals in a smaller setting. 
In the meantime, we will be incorporating all your suggestions 
for improving the quality and utility of these workshops.
