# August workshop updates

## Aug 21 update

Hello colleagues, 

Thank you for registering to attend the August workshop! This email may look long, but it's only a 2 min read and contains useful information. 

### Logistics

The [workshop homepage](http://nih-data-commons.us/2018-august-workshop/) provides details about the venue, hotel suggestions, directions from O'Hare and Midway airports, and links to the agenda, list of attendees, code of conduct, GitHub, Google Drive, reimbursement information, and Slack.

The main meeting will be on the 19th floor of [the Equitable Building at 401 N. Michigan St](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Equitable+Building,+401+N+Michigan+Ave,+Chicago,+IL+60611/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x880e2caeb090f199:0x59416c1cc80ae2b7?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj7i_3umIHcAhXpg1QKHf8mDD8Q8gEIKDAA). Some breakout groups will be on the 9th floor.

### Agenda

For the first time, I have included a schedule of all lightning talks and proposed breakout groups (as of today) on [the agenda](http://nih-data-commons.us/2018-august-workshop/agenda) for easy reference. 

Please submit breakout groups suggestions and speaker names by Friday, August 24. You can do so by [opening or commenting on an issue in the workshop Github repository](https://github.com/dcppc/2018-august-workshop/issues). 

### Lightning talks
 
Rather than continuing to go in alphabetical order, I have randomized the order of team talks. Importantly, I also estimated the time for each speaker assuming 8 minutes each with 1 minute for speaker change over, and we have only about a 10-minute buffer for talks going over. While questions are highly encouraged, let's save the lengthy discussions for coffee breaks, lunch, and breakout groups. 

As always, the lightning talks will be [broadcast and recorded via Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/364678101) for remote participation. 

### Breakout groups

I have already received suggestions for 8 breakout groups. We have 6 conference rooms reserved that seat 6, 10, and 16 people as well as comfortable seating in lounges around the building. Rooms locations will be assigned at the meeting.

*Disclaimer:* Team Copper will not be creating zoom channels for breakout groups. We strongly encourage you to limit your breakout groups to in-person-only participation to take advantage of this unique opportunity to actually speak face to face with colleagues from different cities. However, if you are set on inviting remote participants, you will be responsible for setting up your own conference call. If you need a Zoom account, you can email <dcppc.inbox@gmail.com> 

### Overflow space

We think that face-to-face communication during breakout groups and meals is so important that we allowed the number of attendees to surpass capacity (even after a few teams cut back their number of attendees). As a result, we have 67 attendees, but the lightning talks will be held in a room with classroom seating for 60. 

I've seen many of you have private conversations in the lounge rather than attend this talks, and this is fine by me, even encouraged if that is the best use of your time. Additionally, the talks will be broadcast to an adjacent conference room that can be used by anyone who would prefer to work on their laptop at a desk (rather than in their lap) while listening to talks. 

### Dinner

We have arranged for a pre-paid dinner at Fogo de Chao on Monday evening. This is not required. If you chose to not attend the dinner, check out the [list of things in Chicago](http://nih-data-commons.us/2018-august-workshop/tourism)!

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  I look forward to seeing all of you in Chicago. 

Safe travels,
Rayna Harris (Team Copper)
