### Workshop details and logistics

The [workshop homepage](http://nih-data-commons.us/2018-august-workshop/) provides details about the venue, hotel suggestions, directions from O'Hare and Midway airports, and links to the agenda, list of attendees, code of conduct, GitHub, Google Drive, reimbursement information, and Slack.

The meeting venue, [the “The Equitable Building” at 401 N. Michigan St.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Equitable+Building,+401+N+Michigan+Ave,+Chicago,+IL+60611/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x880e2caeb090f199:0x59416c1cc80ae2b7?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj7i_3umIHcAhXpg1QKHf8mDD8Q8gEIKDAA), is access restricted; therefore, we will close registration on August 21 to allow time to coordinate building access, wifi, and parking.

### Participation

We have a cap on registration at 60 people. [Forty-nine people have already registered](http://nih-data-commons.us/2018-august-workshop/attendees)! Project managers and contacts, please discuss with your team and who will attend and how they will participate. 

We love to see new faces at the workshop and hear new voices at each workshop, so please encourage your teammates to attend. These meetings are excellent for sharing ideas and building relationships.

### Agenda

The skeleton [agenda is here](http://nih-data-commons.us/2018-august-workshop/agenda). As before, we will have lightning talks in the morning and breakout groups in the afternoon. Please pay attention to the time when giving talks to ensure that all speakers have equal time to answer questions. 

In order to have a finalize agenda at the start of the workshop, please submit breakout groups suggestions and sign up to give a talk on Friday, August 24. You can do so by [opening or commenting on an issue in the workshop Github repository](https://github.com/dcppc/2018-august-workshop/issues). 

As always, the lightning talks will be [broadcast and recorded via Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/364678101). Requests for Zoom breakout sessions can be made directly in the related issue, communicated over [Slack](http://bit.ly/DCPPCslack), or via email to <dcppc.inbox@gmail.com>.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. 

Best,
Rayna Harris (Team Copper)
