_To be sent to only workshop registrants_

Hi colleagues,

Thanks so much for registering for the June Data Commons Pilot Phase Consortium (DCPPC) Workshop in Portland! 

We are really excited about having this workshop be co-located with the [Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC)](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gccbosc2018/collaboration/). You have probably received some emails from the BOSC organizers. You are more than welcome to participate in non-DCPPC events going on at BOSC in the same manner that BOSC attendees will be encouraged to attend our DCPPC events for cross-pollination. 

The DCPPC is organizing both a workshop and a full-stacks hackathon! All DCPPC participants will come together for the welcome and closing talks but will fork into two tracks for the bulk of each day. 

Please visit these useful links below for more details.
