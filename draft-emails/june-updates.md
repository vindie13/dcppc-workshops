Hi colleagues,

Thanks so much for registering for the June Data Commons Pilot Phase Consortium (DCPPC) Workshop in Portland! 

We are really excited about having this workshop be co-located with the [Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC)](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gccbosc2018/collaboration/). You have probably received some emails from the BOSC organizers. You are more than welcome to participate in non-DCPPC events going on at BOSC in the same manner that BOSC attendees will be encouraged to attend our DCPPC events for cross-pollination. 

The DCPPC is organizing both a workshop and a full-stacks hackathon! Please visit these useful links below for more details.

Hello colleagues,

The June workshop kicks off this Friday! Attendees at the [GCCBOSC conference](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gccbosc2018/) have generated a lot of enthusiasm for the Data Commons, and I'm excited that this will carry over into our workshop. 

Here are some frequently asked logistical questions and answers:

* **Where is it?** The Reed College Performing Arts Building (PAB). Our morning talks will be in the auditorium, room PAB 320. The full stack hackathon will be in classroom PAB 131. The breakout sessions will be in open spaces in the PAB atrium. 

* **What about parking and wifi?** Those details are on our [workshop homepage](http://nih-data-commons.us/2018-june-workshop/).

* **Where do I go for help?** The conference help desk is on the first floor of the PAB. If you have questions/concern/suggestions, posting them on [Slack](https://nih-dcppc.slack.com/messages/CAMLGP27N/convo/GANQFSGAD-1529251581.000033/) will get the fastest response but feel free to email <dcppc.inbox@gmail.com> or <rayna.harris@gmail.com>. 

* **What's the agenda?** View the [agenda here](http://nih-data-commons.us/2018-june-workshop/agenda). _Note there are links to GitHub issues for lighting talk order and to Zoom for remote participation._

* **Where do I post my slides or notes?** Please upload your slides to the [June workshop folder in our Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19oA9Us4-2ev3UeKDYN1d2D9UjNNS7llk?usp=sharing). 

Safe travels! See you in Portland!
