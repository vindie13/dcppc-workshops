_To be sent to only workshop registrants_

Hi colleagues,

Thanks so much for registering for the June DCPPC Workshop in Portland! 

We are really excited about having this workshop be co-located with the [Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC)](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com). You have probably received some emails from the BOSC organizers. You are more than welcome to participate in non-DCPPC events going on at BOSC in the same manner than BOSC attendees will be encouraged to attend our DCPPC events for cross-pollination. 

The DCPPC is organizing both a workshop and a full-stacks hackathon! Please visit these useful links below for more details.
