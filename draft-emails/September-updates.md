## Sept 6 email 

Dear Colleagues,

Thank you for your patience while we looked for more rooms in Boston to accommodate the increasing demand for attendance at the September workshop. 

I estimate about ~70 people will attend and have reopened registration accordingly. If you were on the waitlist, please check your email and update your registration to provide your team name, dietary preferences, etc.

The lightning talks will be in Kresge G3 on Sep. 20 and Countway Lahey Room 5 on the 21st. These rooms accommodate 70 and 60 people, respectively, so we also have overflow rooms available in Countway should we need them.

For breakout sessions, we have reserved 6 small rooms for the 20th and 4 on the 21st. Please propose your breakout group topics by submitting a new issue at http://bit.ly/SeptBreakout

By-invitation-only events: The Stage Steering Committee Meeting will be in Countway 320 on Sept 20. The Commonsing meeting will be in Countway 403 and 320 on the 21st. The C4 meeting on the 19th is TBD. For questions about these events, please contact Sarah Davis, Titus Brown, or Jen Ytrri, respectively. 

Please let me know if you have questions or concerns. See you in Boston!

Best,
Rayna (Team Copper)


## August 31 email

Hello Colleagues,

You are registered to attend the next DCPPC workshop in Boston on September 20-21. 
Here are some important updates **that require a response**. 

Before I begin, I plan on circulating a document with highlights, 
key decisions and links to all documents related to the August and September workshops. 
So even if you cannot or chose not to attend, we are doing our best to improve the 
dissemination of information and reduce the fear of missing out :)

1. **Registration is temporarily closed.** 
You can view the current list of attendees [here](http://nih-data-commons.us/2018-september-workshop/attendees). 
I have space for 10 more people, but I imagine many more than 10 want to attend, 
so we must prioritize and perhaps adjust.  
Teams Calcium, Helium, Hydrogen, and Xenon all have 6+ attendees, 
so I'm capping your team's registration. 
Please discuss within your team why each person needs to attend as see if it is possible to cut back.  
Teams Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, & Sodium only have 1 attendee, 
but I imagine would like to send more. 
**Action item:** please contact Rayna Harris (via slack or email) with the names of attendees you would like to remove or add by Tues. Sept 4th.  

   
1. **Reimbursements.** As always, we will reimburse your travel expenses, 
but we need to better predict them, especially when funds are running low.  
Therefore, we added 2 new questions to registration. 
**Action item:** please click on `VIEW TICKET` at the bottom of this email, 
then click `Change` and answer the 2 new questions at the bottom.

    
1. **Talks and breakouts** 
The deadline for proposing breakouts or submitting names for speakers is Monday, Sept 17.  
This includes letting me know if no one from your team will present. 
Talks and breakout groups are coordinated via GitHub Issues 
here: https://github.com/dcppc/2018-september-workshop/issues. 

     
Thanks in advance for your cooperation. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Best,
Rayna Harris (Team Copper)
