Hello Colleagues,

You are registered to attend the next DCPPC workshop in Boston on September 20-21. 
Here are some important updates **that require a response**. 

Before I begin, I plan on circulating a document with highlights, 
key decisions and links to all documents related to the August and September workshops, 
so even if you cannot or chose not to attend, we are doing our best to improve the 
dissemination of information and reduce the fear of missing out :)

1. **Registration is temporarily closed.** 
You can view the current list of attendees [here](http://nih-data-commons.us/2018-september-workshop/attendees). 
I have space for 10 more people, but I imagine many more than 10 want to attend, 
so we must prioritize and perhaps adjust.  
Teams Calcium, Helium, Hydrogen, and Xenon all have 6+ attendees, 
so I'm capping your team's registration. 
Please discuss within your team why each person needs to attend as see if it is possible to cut back.  
Teams Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, & Sodium only have 1 attendee, 
but I imagine would like to send more. 
**Action item:** please contact Rayna Harris (via slack or email) with the names of attendees you would like to remove or add by Tues. Sept 4th.  

   
1. **Reimbursements.** As always, we will reimburse your travel expenses, 
but we need to better predict them, especially when funds are running low.  
Therefore, we added 2 new questions to registration. 
**Action item:** please click on `VIEW TICKET` at the bottom of this email, 
then click `Change` and answer the 2 new questions at the bottom.

    
1. **Talks and breakouts** 
The deadline for proposing breakouts or submitting names for speakers is Monday, Sept 17.  
This includes letting me know if no one from your team will present. 
Talks and breakout groups are coordinated via GitHub Issues 
here: https://github.com/dcppc/2018-september-workshop/issues. 

     
Thanks in advance for your cooperation. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Best,
Rayna Harris (Team Copper)
