## May 21 - registration full

subject: Registration for the May workshop is full!

Hi colleagues,

Good news! We've maxed out registration for the May workshop! We are thrilled that so many people are able to attend on relatively short notice. 

Unfortunately, this now means we have a few people on the waitlist. If you registered but since realized that you can't make it, please cancel your registration so that someone on the waitlist can take your spot.

Thanks,
Rayna (and the rest of Team Copper)

## May 21 - show and tell emails

subject: Preparing for the May workshop
audience: registrants

Hi colleagues,

We would like to kick off the May workshop by having a representative from each team and the data stewards give a 5 min "show and tell" talk. The goal of these informative but informal talks is for everyone in the Data Commons to gain a better sense of who's who and what people are working on. The only constraint is the 5-minute time limit.  _Anyone_ from the team can present. Slides are _not_ required, but if you prepare sides, please upload them to the Google Drive subfolder here https://goo.gl/hEV1jR.

Suggestions for breakout session topics have started to roll in (see https://github.com/dcppc/2018-may-workshop/issues). Please take a look at proposed sessions, and feel free to comment or add your own suggestions! 

_If_ you would like try and memorize some DCPPC terms, associations and affiliations before the meeting, check out these fun network matching games from Avi Ma'ayan at http://www.maayanlab.net/NMG/2018/. My attached "DCPPC cheatsheet" is a good reference for playing Avi's games.

Thanks,
Rayna (and the rest of Team Copper)
