## What to expect
The goals of this un-conference style event are to build community, to facilitate planned and serendipitous collaboration across teams, and to surface hidden issues around technical and conceptual interoperability. On Wednesday, May 30, actives will focus on communicating the awesome things we've done already. On Thursday, May 31 activities will suport more brainstorming and planning on the future.  Ad hoc breakouts are hugely supported!
