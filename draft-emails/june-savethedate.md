Save the date: June DCPPC Workshop

Hi colleagues,

The June DCPPC meeting will take place on Friday-Saturday, June 29-30 in Portland, Oregon. 

This meeting will be part of a larger 'CollaborationFest' taking place at Bioinformatics Open Source Conference 2018 (BOSC2018). Many Data Commons members will be at the meeting anyway. You are all encouraged and welcome to attend the BOSC training events and meeting, but your attendance is not a prerequisite for participating in the Data Commons workshops. https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/

CollaborationFest is free! You still need to register here: https://galaxyproject.org/events/gccbosc2018/register

Lodging in the Sitka Block of Reed campus is available for attendees without children. https://galaxyproject.org/events/gccbosc2018/venue/

Childcare is available! However, space is very limited and you are encouraged to book childcare right now. Childcare is not on-site, and you must also secure for off-campus housing.

Reimbursements will be issued for travel and lodging via UC Davis. More details at https://github.com/dcppc/2018-may-workshop/tree/master/reimbursements

Feel free to ask more question via email or on slack at https://nih-dcppc.slack.com/messages/CAMLGP27N/convo/C7ULH1XRT-1525894861.000398/?

We hope to see you there!
