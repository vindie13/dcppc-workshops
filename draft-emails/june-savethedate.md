Save the date: June DCPPC Workshop

Hi colleagues,

The June DCPPC meeting will take place on Friday-Saturday, June 29-30 in Portland, Oregon. 

This meeting will be part of a larger 'CollaborationFest' taking place at Bioinformatics Open Source Conference 2018 (BOSC2018). Many Data Commons members will be at the meeting anyways, but your attendance at the main meeting is not an obligation to participate in the Data Commons workshops.

CollaborationFest is free! You still need to register here: https://galaxyproject.org/events/gccbosc2018/register

Lodging in the Sitka Block of Reed campus is available. https://galaxyproject.org/events/gccbosc2018/venue/

Childcare is available! However, space is very limited and you are encouraged to book childcare right now. https://galaxyproject.org/events/gccbosc2018/childcare/

The Data Commons will reimburse your travel expenses. 

We hope to see you there!

Team Copper!
